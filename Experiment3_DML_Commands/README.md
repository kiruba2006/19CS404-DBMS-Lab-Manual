# Experiment 3: DML Commands

## AIM
To study and implement DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands.

## THEORY

### 1. INSERT INTO
Used to add records into a relation.
These are three type of INSERT INTO queries which are as
A)Inserting a single record
**Syntax (Single Row):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES (value_1, value_2, ...);
```
**Syntax (Multiple Rows):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES
(value_1, value_2, ...),
(value_3, value_4, ...);
```
**Syntax (Insert from another table):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name SELECT * FROM other_table WHERE condition;
```
### 2. UPDATE
Used to modify records in a relation.
Syntax:
```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
```
### 3. DELETE
Used to delete records from a relation.
**Syntax (All rows):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
```
**Syntax (Specific condition):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### 4. SELECT
Used to retrieve records from a table.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Question 1**
--
Write a SQL statement to change salary of employee to 8000 whose Employee ID is 105, if the existing salary is less than 5000.

```sql
update employees set salary=8000 where employee_id=105 and salary<5000;
```

**Output:**

**Question 2**
---
Write a SQL query to reduce the reorder level by 30% where cost price is more than 50 and quantity in stock is less than 100 in the products table.

```sql
update products set reorder_lvl=reorder_lvl*0.70 where cost_price > 50 and quantity<100;
```

**Output:**

**Question 3**
---
Write a SQL statement to increase the salary of employees under the department 40, 90 and 110 according to the company rules.

Salary will be increased by 25% for the department 40, 15% for department 90 and 10% for the department 110 and the rest of the departments will remain same.

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = CASE 
    WHEN department_id = 40  THEN CAST(ROUND(salary * 1.25, 0) AS INT)
    WHEN department_id = 90  THEN CAST(ROUND(salary * 1.15, 0) AS INT)
    WHEN department_id = 110 THEN CAST(ROUND(salary * 1.10, 0) AS INT)
    ELSE salary
END;
```

**Question 4**
---
Write a SQL statement to Change the supplier name to 'A1 Suppliers' where the supplier ID is 8 in the suppliers table.

```sql
update suppliers set supplier_name='A1 Suppliers' where supplier_id = 8;
```

**Question 5**
---
For  Increase the selling price per unit by 3 for all products supplied by supplier ID 4 in the sales table.

```sql
UPDATE sales
SET sell_price = sell_price + 3
WHERE product_id IN (
    SELECT product_id 
    FROM products 
    WHERE supplier_id = 4
);
```

**Output:**

```sql
delete from Customer where GRADE=2 and CUST_NAME LIKE 'M%' AND PAYMENT_AMT<3000;
```

**Output:**
